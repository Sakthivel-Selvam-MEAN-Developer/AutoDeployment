## Work ethics
1. Build should always be green [![Build Status](https://github.com/WonderWhyDev/WonderWhy/actions/workflows/actions.yml/badge.svg)]
   1. **stop committing if build is red**
2. Understand why you are doing something before you do it. That is why we call the company `WonderWhy`
   * talk to clients/customers to understand the problem before jumping to solution
   * discuss and agree the best solution for the problem, before implementing it
   * Solving customer problem is the most important thing, not completing the task
   * no question is a stupid question.
3. Communicate proactively. Ex. taking leave, mistakes done. Don't wait to be asked.
4. Work in a single story at any time. Finish it, get customer feedback and move to next story.
5. When picking a story, break it down into smaller tasks, list then in the story and then start working on them.
6. Write test first, then write code to make the test pass.
7. Start the day with 
   * daily update. docs/DailyUpdate.md
   * read code written by others
8. Respect lint rules, warning limits and don't change them without discussion.
9. Name things properly. Be it file name, test name, variable name, function name, table name, field name, etc.
      * don't use abbreviations
      * don't use single letter variable names
      * don't use generic names like `data`, `value`, `result`, etc.
      * be cognizant about singular vs plural
10. Add you name/pair's name in the commit message, so that we know who to ask if we have questions.
11. You should understand every word of code/command that you use or written by you
12. Constantly look way of improving
      * yourself by readying unknown topics, getting deep into known topics
      * code by refactoring, removing duplication, improving performance, etc.
